# Automatic-langage-detection

This was a university project, the goal was to implement an automatic detection program using 2 different data structures to store words from 3 different dictionaries, and compare the results. The main objective of this project was not language detection, but how we had to store and parse through sizeable data.

The first one is a Trie tree, which is fairly easy to implement, but is not the most efficient memory wise.
The second one is a DAWG, or a Directed acyclic word graph, which is much harder to implement, but is much more efficient memory wise. 

This project was very interesting, I was able to put the tools I had learned during the course to use.
