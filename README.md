# Automatic-langage-detection

This was a university project, the goal was to implement an automatic detection program using 2 different data structures to store words from 3 different dictionaries, and compare the results.

The first one is a Trie tree, which is fairly easy to implement, but is not the most efficient memory wise.
The second one is DAWG, or a Directed acyclic word graph, which is much harder to implement, but is much more efficient memory wise, even tho the time it takes to add the dictionaries.

All the details are in the report .
